 - id shifts in LOF in warm core
 - extract the temperature affected genes (warm - cold), grep? could be an approach
 - comparison between pops, parsing
 - outputs?
	1st step
		any LOF mutations
	2nd step
		one or several events, complexity

 - homo/het, maybe only include serious deleterious mutations?
 - LOF --> type of gene? --> single event, lots?

 - cost-estimate for more Nanopore sequencing! S. subsalsum v2!


 - P8352 can be re-run as genotypecaller didn't work

 - run snpeff again
 - lovisa spls,
	is there a signal there for LOF v
 - all samples - are some genes ever/never mutated, etc?

1 / ID LOF IDs from snpeff output > <filename>
2 / filter those IDs from geno output
 - vcftools --vcf file.vcf --snps <filename> --recode will keep only the SNPs with IDs in <filename>.

 - so maybe plotting all of the things not the best idea?
	how about directing user to:
		vcftools to obtain manhattan plot of Fst values for pop and plot only by pops
		IGV to visualize VCFs
			this would follow inspection of M plots so user could circumscribe it to 
				i.e. one chromosome 
 - for vcftools fst:
	1. merge vcfs
		needs space delimited inputs
		-m none
		output -Ov -o x.vcf
	2. vcftools fst
		needs
			1 merged vcf
			1 text file per pop
			--out = prefix
			tsv output? (test)
	3. manhattan plot
		seaborn

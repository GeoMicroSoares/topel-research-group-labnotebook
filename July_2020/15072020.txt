 - vcftools not working for fst calculations
	not a matter of:
		id merging with bcftools
		chrom field not being present
		sample names w . in vcf

 - so vilma's pipeline really does this... no use in reinventing the wheel........

 - so just the summary then from lof data analysis?

 - jfc

 - ok change lof_data_analysis.py to summarize.. smth
 - create new plotly-based solution to relate fst pairwise matrices in a PCA with metadata?

 - copy Vilma's pipeline first and test

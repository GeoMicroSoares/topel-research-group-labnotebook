 - maybe dashboard isn't that good of an idea?
 - maybe plotly "barplot" with colours for:
	indels (0-50bp)
	SVs (>50bp)
		where x = chromosomes
		"rows" = samples
		colours = SVs, etc
		annotations for genes, LOF, NMD data with plotly


 - vilma's code for plotly output?
	high_charts
	IGV? server to show outputs
	per chrm? all?
	info submitted to it? to viz in IGV?
	overview
	BED format - tsv for IGV
	population definition on utility script
	vcf -> 10 vcf to utility script w metadta  -> compare pops? different plot?
	pops 
	agnostic vcf -> metadata on utility script

 - getting this for P14203_180 after running sv_caller.
 - seems like an R error, check it out
Error in `[[<-`(`*tmp*`, name, value = NA_character_) :
  1 elements in value to replace 0 elements
Calls: $<- -> $<- -> [[<- -> [[<-
Execution halted

 - after checking better seems a small number of detected SV calls were all masked and an empty vcf was generated after that.
 - sv_caller.py needs warnings/etc in cases like these
 - Issue was added to repo


 - how to summarize svs in vcfs
 - total numbers of del, ins, etc won't necessarily reflect effects

 - need to sort out snpeff config file:
	without it snpeff is very upset
	tried using just -dataDir but no
	now trying to use a config file and -dataDir
	however, if this is to be automated, how to change config file for each ref genome?
	data.dir can be changed easily, but how about the last lines in the config file?
	starting with data.dir for now

 - lines needed in the bottom of config file:

#Skeletonema marinoi reference v1.1.2
Smarinoi.v112.genome : Smarinoi_v112
Smarinoi.v112.codonTable : Standard
Smarinoi.v112.Sm_Mitochondrion_S_marinoi_RO5_v1.1.codonTable : Mold_Mitochondrial
Smarinoi.v112.Sm_Chloroplast_S_marinoi_RO5_v1.1.codonTable : Bacterial_and_Plant_Plastid
Smarinoi.v112.reference : /proj/data26/Skeletonema_marinoi_genome_project/12_remove_redundancy/Fake_Primary_Removal/Smar_v1.1.2.fasta

 how hard can it be to automate this as bamboozle is installed?
